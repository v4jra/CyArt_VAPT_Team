# Executive Summary – Non-Technical (100 Words)

This security assessment evaluated the DVWA and Metasploitable2 systems to identify weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. Several critical issues were discovered, including outdated software versions, weak authentication controls, and vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), command execution flaws, and insecure file upload mechanisms. Publicly exposed services further increased risk. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or compromise the entire system. Immediate actions such as updating software, validating user input, and restricting unnecessary services are strongly recommended. A follow-up security scan should be performed after these fixes.
