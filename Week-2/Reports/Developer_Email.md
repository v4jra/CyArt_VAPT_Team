**Subject:** Critical Security Vulnerabilities Identified – Immediate Fix Required

Hello Team,

During the recent VAPT assessment, multiple high-risk vulnerabilities were identified in the application. DVWA exhibited exploitable SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), OS Command Injection, and unrestricted File Upload flaws. A working proof-of-concept confirmed that user-supplied input was executed directly on the server, enabling command execution and unauthorized file uploads. These issues pose serious risks, including data leakage, privilege escalation, and full system compromise.

Please prioritize remediation by implementing robust input validation and disabling unnecessary services. I am available to assist with retesting after fixes are deployed.

Regards,  
**Security Analyst**
