# Exploitation Phase – Overview

## Targets & Environment
- **Target 1:** DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)  
- **Target 2:** Metasploitable 2  
- **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux  
- **Environment:** Private, controlled VAPT lab setup  
- **Tools Used:** Burp Suite, sqlmap, Metasploit, Browser Exploits  

---

## Scope of Exploitation
The exploitation phase included:
- Validating high-risk vulnerabilities discovered during scanning  
- Testing web-based exploits on DVWA (SQLi, XSS, LFI, File Upload, OS Command Injection)  
- Testing service-level exploits on Metasploitable 2 (e.g., Tomcat Manager RCE)  
- Capturing proof-of-concept and command execution screenshots  
- Maintaining actions strictly within the authorized lab environment  

No privilege escalation or pivoting beyond lab scope was performed.

## Summary
This phase focused on safely exploiting vulnerabilities in DVWA and Metasploitable 2 to demonstrate real-world attack scenarios. DVWA was used to simulate common web application attacks, while Metasploitable 2 allowed exploitation of outdated services using Metasploit. Each exploit was validated with screenshots and PoC payloads for documentation. The goal was to understand exploit behavior, impact, and mapping to real-world security risks—not to cause damage or persistence.
